    <h2>Introduction:</h2>  
    <p>
          My site is to advertise a dance association called ABD dance association.  I came to the idea of this newsletter as a way to expand the knowledge of the "association".
          <br><br>I was previously a dancer in my previous institution and have been pursuing the Indian classical form of   dance for over ten years. During this time, I learnt that the basic information we know about a dance form does   not represent the dance form itself. Many who are keen to expand their knowledge and learn a dance form are not   provided with enough detail and are not able to find quick access to forms that they can sign to enter a dance   academy. 
          <br><br>Henceforth, I came up with this website to educate them on the various dance forms and promote this "dance association". The web new letter is not based on a true association. The main story I would like to show is how the generic flow of a dance association would feel like. I would also advertise the different areas in a dance association where former members are also welcomed. 
          <br><br>The background image of a wooden board resembles the wooden flooring in a dance studio. To provide readers with a feel of the dance surroundings, it was chosen to be the background image.  A navigation bar enables the user to be able to move from one page to another easily. There have been articles linked to the dance forms where the user will learn a piece of new knowledge on the dance form and at the same time the scenario behind each course.  There is also an about page where users can learn more about the institution. The parent page is for parents who are interested in joining the volunteer service at the association. Adding on to that there are a form page and a feedback page where the user can sign up and leave comments about the information given. This feedback will then be used to review and improve the newsletter.

       <h2>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</h2> 
        <p>
          1. The main thing that inspired me to create this website would be my desire to enable many people to learn about how the dance associations work and provide others with the opportunity to learn many of the dance forms. As a dancer myself, I did not get enough information about the different dance forms. I was told that most of them were hard and it cannot be performed. As I entered my junior college and learnt more about contemporary and jazz, I realised that once you practice, it is not hard to dance this dance. As such I want to promote the different dance forms and provide a source of courage to users who visit this site to join dance associations and to learn the different dance forms.<br><br>
          2.Ted Talks that I often listened to also inspired me to create this site. Especially the portion of the parent's page and the blog page. The blog page motivates the user either to join as a volunteer or participate by joining a particular dance form. The parent page was to motivate home-makers who are parents of the people learning the dance to volunteer and contribute to the association. This way they can be a support to their children or relation who are students of the association's academy. I was also a way to make the parents understand the hurdles of organising an event.<br><br>
          3.My dance instructor inspired me to create this website. Being in charge of a small dance school, she has a dance page on Facebook where she uploads online performances and online live events. The effort she puts on to convey information to others motivated me to create this website to convey information across the world about dance associations and the different dance forms.

       <h2>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h2> 
        <p>
          1.My website is accessible as the font size can be enlarged to read minute information on the webpage without the necessity to use the zoom function on a device.<br><br>
          2.My website is also accessible as the colour combination is constructed in a way where it does not strain the eyes of the person using it. This is achieved through CSS where the font is bolded and the correct colour contrast is used for the website.<br><br>
          3.There is always a "h1" heading on top of the page that enables the user to be notified on the page they are on which enhances the accessibility of the page. Through this strategy, the webpage is also more accessible. 
        </p> 
        </div>

        <h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h2> 
        <p>
          1.Through my website, one can navigate easily through the webpages and the articles. There is a navigation bar at the top of the page which navigates the user to the relevant pages. Additionally, some buttons link the user to the next relevant article or page. For example in the CLASS page, there is a "Read More" button that directs the person to an article regarding the specific dance form. Another example would be the enter next page button that directs the user from the FORM page to the FEEDBACK page.<br><br>
          2.My website has a consistent web design that would also increase usability.  The separate pages have a similar layout which enables the user to be properly familiarised with the page which would in the long run enhance the usability.<br><br> 
          3.The FEEDBACK and FORM page of the website increases the usability as the user now can comment on the website and give possible suggestions that increase the interaction with the client and at the same time improves the website through the data collected. With the FORM page, the user would have a sense of belonging to the website as they are able to interact with the association directly to sign up and enrol in the institution.

        <div id = "position"> 
        <h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
         how you did that</h2> 
        <p>
          1. I learnt more about using the JavaScript functionality that was not shown in the Coursera video which was to validate a form. To validate a form, the javascript can enable us to detect the word strength of the user's input and deny the person to submit the form if the information given was unacceptable. This could be done with the if conditional statements whereby you have to first locate the DOM element for that certain input. This was achieved through referring to a few youtube video where one provided the optimum reference for the bracket application.
          <br><br>   
          2. I also learnt about how JavaScript can be used to change the font size of a web page without changing the positionings of the DOM elements on a page. This is also done by first finding the DOM elements that are required and using CSS to decipher the font size of the relevant "T" which changes the font size from small to medium to large through the "for loop". This was achieved through the reference of the Coursera video. 
          <br><br>    
          3. I learnt about the different CSS that can be used to make a font look "engraved" into the background. This can be achieved through the -webkit-background-clip, text-shadow and the rgba values. The -webkit-background-clip is set to text and the -text-shadow is given the pixel values and the rgba colour code gives the font the transparency along with the RGB colour code values. This application of the CSS was found from the w3schools website.

        <div id = "position"> 
        <h2> What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2> 
        <p>
          1.The first aspect that worked well was the application form to sign up for lessons at the association. It provided usability for the user as he/she is now able to join lessons through the association with the click of a button. The form also validates whether the information is stated correctly which improves the quality of the form as the user now can identify the requirements for each aspect of the form.<br><br>
          2.The second aspect would be the navigation bar. A scrollable navigation bar enables the user to move forward to various pages without having to scroll to the top which provides an ease to the user. The buttons that link all the HTML pages is also conducive as the pages are now all very accessible.<br><br>
          3.Another aspect that worked well was the image carousel which transitions from the first page to the next in 10 seconds. This attracts the user as the feature is something cool to observe when visiting a site. It is also more user friendly as the user does not have to manually scroll through the various pages.<br><br> 
          4.One last aspect that worked well is the changing of text size. This enables the reader to read more clearly and at the same time have the positioning remained unchanged.

        <div id = "position"> 
        <h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
        another time?</h2> 
        <p>
         1. I could improve on making my page more accessible. For examples being available on small screens like a mobile phone. This would increase the number of users who visit my website. Changing font size may not be enough for users to view the page especially on a small screen<br><br>
         2. Another aspect that could be worked on would be the loading time for the page to appear. Lesser CSS could be used the next time so that users can access the screen at a quicker amount of time
