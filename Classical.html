        The specific classical dance we are going to be conducting would be Russian Ballet. Russian ballet features high extensions and dynamic turns, whereas Italian ballet tends to be more grounded, with a focus on fast, intricate footwork. <br>
        This dance form includes agility, strength, flexibility and many more important attributes which would take years to master. Turns, leaps, kicks are common to dance movements that a dancer will learn in this form in our academy. <br>
        For beginners, we would recommend loosening the knees, extending arms to the sides and keeping a calm and confident posture as a training exercise in order to keep up with our dance practices. <br>
        If you are a beginner, you do not have to worry as we have patient and understanding instructors who would assist you all the way. We hope to see you soon in our academy.<br>
