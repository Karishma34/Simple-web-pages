        Jazz is a dance technique that originated in the United States of America in the early 20th century. It comes from a mix of American pop culture which includes African and Celtic influence.<br>
        This dance form includes agility, strength, flexibility and many more important attributes which would take years to master. Turns, leaps, kicks are common to dance movements that a dancer will learn in this form in our academy. <br>
        For beginners, we would recommend loosening the knees, extending arms to the sides and keeping a calm and confident posture as a training exercise in order to keep up with our dance practices. <br>
        If you are a beginner, you do not have to worry as we have patient and understanding instructors who would assist you all the way. We hope to see you soon in our academy.<br>
