        Fusion is a mixture of dance forms. There many types of fusion dance. The one we would be covering is a mixture between Indigenous dance forms and Contemporary dance forms.This is a new form of dance that this academy is working on.<br>
            
        This dance form includes agility, strength, flexibility and many more important attributes which would take years to master. It includes expression, emotion and each dance would have its own meaning. <br>
            
        For beginners, we would recommend that you follow instructions given by the instructors themselves as it might be unique.<br>
            
        If you are a beginner, you do not have to worry as we have patient and understanding instructors who would assist you all the way. We hope to see you soon in our academy.<br>
