                   <p>Through my experience as a dancer, I learnt many values, morals that has helped me achieve greater heights as a dancer, a student, a family member and certainly as a mom. Many may think that this is just a myth. That it is not true. But that is not the case. As a dancer, I learnt more about the outside world, the people around me. The most valuable lesson I learnt is that no one can help you but yourself.I am glad to stand proud as a model citizen, a family member and a mom. This would not have happened if I hadn't been a former student of this association. I am certainly glad to volunteer myself in this association as a volunteer. More Information on this volunteering scheme would be available in the Parent Page.</p></div>
