        <p style = "font-family: monospace;font-weight:10; font-size: 20px;">Our students are the pride of our academy as they exhibit good values like Care, Concern, Pride, Harmony, Sympathy, Honesty and Resilience. We envision each of our students to possess these qualities to be a compassionate dancer. We also aim to get our students be a Global Thinker with a Mission and Kindness. No one should be left behind and none should present themselves as superior. These are some abilities we want our students to possess as an association of excellence. </p></div>
