        Dance Mom 1: As a dancer, I had faced many challenges along the way to come to a level of recognition and I am glad that my daughter got a placing in this academy as she did not have to face the hurdles I did to reach to the same level as me. I am also thankful to the academy for the great opportunity and I hope the academy continues to engage in this activity.<br>
